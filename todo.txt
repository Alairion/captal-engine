Priority:
H: high
A: average
L: low
I: just an idea

Tephra:
H: Generic render target (complete render pass build with almost everything possible with pure Vulkan)
H: Complete commands list
A: Complete physical devices properties structures
L: Performance query support
I: Multiple queue support ? (maybe overkill for 2D, but may be useful for 3D (since tephra is a generic renderer))

Swell:
H: Split mixer in multiple class: audio world responsible of spacialization and first mixing which contains sounds and a listener; the mixer contains audio worlds which outputs are mixed together by the mixer then gave to the user
L: Rewrite audio stream to reduce the number of internal threads by 1 (write to the stream without using port audio callback)
L: Support other platforms (as of 18 may 2020 only Win32/OSX/Linux are supported)

Apyre:
A: Game controller / joystick support
A: Dialogbox support (with native style, mainly for error reports)
A: Clipboard support

Captal:
H: Complete text rendering support (alignments, stylized)
A: More primitive shapes (circles, ellipses, convex polygons)
L: Remove std::u32string in cpt::text interface (use cpt::converter_iterator on utf8 encoded std::string_view instead)
I: Virtual file archive system ? (already prototyped)
