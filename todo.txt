Lists are sorted from more important to less important
Priority:
H = high priotiry
A = average priority
L = low priority
I = just an idea

Tephra:
H: Generic render target (complete render pass build with almost everything possible with pure Vulkan)
H: Complete commands list
A: Complete physical devices properties structures
L: Add compute pipeline
I: Multiple queue support ? (maybe overkill for 2D, but may be useful for 3D (since tephra is a generic renderer))

Swell:
H: Split mixer in multiple class: audio world responsible of spacialization and first mixing which contains sounds and a listener; the mixer contains audio worlds which outputs are mixed together by the mixer then gave to the user
L: Rewrite audio stream to reduce the number of internal threads by 1 (write to the stream without using port audio callback)
L: Support other platforms (as of 18 may 2020 only Win32/OSX/Linux are supported)

Apyre:
A: Add dialogbox support (with native style, mainly for error reports)

Captal:
H: Complete text rendering support (alignments, stylized)
A: Add more primitive shapes (circles, ellipses, convex polygons)
I: Create file archive system (already prototyped)
