# Captal Engine
Captal is a C++20 low-level 2D game engine.  
Low level means that, it is not the kind of engine you plug your code in, it is the kind of engine that you plug in your code. 
It also tries to keep the lower overhead as possible, while being accessible by most C++ developpers that have basic knowledge of GPU, audio and game programming.

## Modules

Captal is composed of 5 modules:

* Captal foundation: A header only fully standard library that serve as a base of all other modules.
* Apyre: A windowing and input management library built on SDL2.
* Swell: An audio playback and spacialization library built on Portaudio and other libraries for audio files decoding.
* Tephra: A low-level GPU API based on Vulkan. 
* Captal: The actual game engine, depends of the 4 other modules.
